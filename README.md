# Hangman-Game

In this hangman game a user can choose a difficulty that will give a user more or less guesses depending on what they pick.

If you are able to guess the word before you run out of guesses then your win score will go up by one, a corrisponding image will be display and a success audio will be played. The word you guessed will not be reused and if you continue on by pressing a key or selecting a new difficulty then a new word will randomly be selected.

If you are unable to solve the word before you run out of guesses then your loss count will increase and the word will be removed from the array and another one will be randomly selected.
